# Restaurant Management System - Critical Issues Fixed

## COMPLETED TASKS ✅

### 1. ✅ Real Persistence Between Waiter and Kitchen Modules
- **Enhanced orders.js** with comprehensive localStorage integration
- Added persistent functions: `saveOrders()`, `loadOrders()`, `saveTables()`, `loadTables()`
- Implemented real-time data synchronization between modules
- Added event-driven updates with `ordersUpdated` and `tablesUpdated` events

### 2. ✅ Table Management System
- **Implemented complete table management** in orders.js:
  - `initializeTables()` - Initialize 12 tables with proper status
  - `getTables()` - Retrieve current table states
  - `updateTableStatus()` - Update individual table status
  - `getAvailableTables()` - Get list of available tables
  - `getOccupiedTables()` - Get list of occupied tables
- **Updated waiter module** with proper table integration and order tracking

### 3. ✅ Kitchen Module "Queue" View
- **Added missing queue view** in kitchen.js
- Created `generateQueueView()` function with prioritized order display
- Implemented `generateQueueActionButtons()` for queue-specific actions
- Added proper queue filtering and status management
- Enhanced order priority system for kitchen workflow

### 4. ✅ Complete Order Status Flow
- **Implemented full order lifecycle**: pending → preparing → ready → served → paid
- Added `updateOrderStatus()` function with proper state transitions
- Enhanced status validation and error handling
- Added real-time status synchronization across all modules

### 5. ✅ Menu Item Width Update
- **Updated menu item width** from 180px to 198px in waiter module
- Modified `generateMenuItems()` function in waiter.js
- Maintained proper responsive design and layout consistency

## SYSTEM INTEGRATION ✅

### Data Persistence
- **localStorage-based persistence** for orders and tables
- **Real-time synchronization** between modules
- **Event-driven updates** for UI consistency

### Module Communication
- **Enhanced waiter module** with proper table and order management
- **Complete kitchen module** with queue view and order processing
- **Integrated cashier module** for payment processing
- **Event system** for cross-module communication

### Order Flow
```
Waiter → Select Table → Add Items → Send to Kitchen
   ↓
Kitchen → View Queue → Start Preparation → Mark Ready
   ↓
Waiter → Serve Order → Mark as Served
   ↓
Cashier → Process Payment → Complete Order
```

## FILES MODIFIED

### Core Data (orders.js)
- Enhanced with table management functions
- Added localStorage persistence
- Implemented event system for real-time updates

### Kitchen Module (kitchen.js) 
- Added missing queue view template
- Implemented queue-specific functions
- Enhanced order processing workflow

### Waiter Module (waiter.js)
- Updated table integration with order tracking
- Enhanced menu display with 198px width
- Added real-time event listeners

## TESTING

Created `test_integration.html` for comprehensive system testing:
- Data persistence verification
- Table management testing
- Kitchen queue functionality
- Menu width validation
- Order flow testing
- Event system integration

## SYSTEM STATUS: FULLY OPERATIONAL ✅

All critical issues have been resolved:
✅ Real persistence between modules
✅ Missing queue view in kitchen
✅ Complete order status flow  
✅ Full table management system
✅ Menu items 10% wider (198px)

The restaurant management system is now fully functional with proper data persistence, complete module integration, and a smooth order flow from waiter to kitchen to cashier.
